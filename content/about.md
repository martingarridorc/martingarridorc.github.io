### Quick start

Computational Biologist. Postdoctoral Fellow at EMBL working between [Saez-Rodriguez team](https://saezlab.org/) and [Savitski team](https://www.embl.org/groups/savitski/). 

### Biography

I am original from Córdoba, a sunny city from the south of Spain. My professional career started in 2015, when I obtained my BSc degree in Biochemistry at the university of my hometown. During the development of my BSc thesis, I had my first contact with the field of bioinformatics, which helped me to decide that I wanted to pursue a career in the field of computational biology applied to biomedical research. 

Therefore, in 2016 I obtained a MSc degree in Translational Biomedical Research, also at the University of Córdoba. In this same year, I moved to Madrid to pursue a second MSc degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the National Institute of Health Carlos III. While studying the masters, I also started working at [innoHealth](https://personal-care.evonik.com/en/about/innohealth), a biotech company focused on providing new scientific solutions to companies in the dermo-cosmetic market. 

After this, I returned to Córdoba/Seville to pursue a PhD in Biomedicine at the University of Córdoba under the supervision of Dr. Calzado and Dr. Muñoz at the [Maimonides Biomedical Research Institute of Córdoba](https://www.imibic.org/), and of Dr. Dopazo at the [Clinical Bioinformatics Area](https://www.clinbioinfosspa.es/). In my PhD project, I focused on the development of new computational methods to perform the functional analysis of multiomics data in different biomedical research contexts. 

In June 2021, I joined [Saez-Rodriguez](https://saezlab.org/) team as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Heidelberg, Germany. During this time, I focused on extracting mechanistic knowledge from multiomics data in the context of [DECIDER](https://www.deciderproject.eu/), an EU project to overcome chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer patients.

In July 2022, I was awarded a Postdoc Fellowship from the [AI Health Innovation Cluster](https://www.aih-cluster.ai/). Thanks to this, I continued my research as a Postdoc Fellow of [EMBL](https://www.embl.org/), where I am working working between [Saez-Rodriguez team](https://saezlab.org/) and [Savitski team](https://www.embl.org/groups/savitski/) to develop novel computational approaches to better analyze and interpret proteomics, phosphoproteomics and thermal proteome profiling data.

### Research interests

My main research interest lies in how to extract mechanistic knowledge from large molecular data, either through the systematic usage of prior biological knowledge or using orthogonal data-driven approaches. Within the field of systems biology, I have a protein-centric perpspective of biological processes, and I am particularly interested in protein-driven signaling. In my research, I am delving into methods that study the transmission of biochemical information using large-scale molecular networks. Finally, I am also interested in the biases present in our knowledge of biological systems. I believe that these biases have received little attention in recent years and that their effect can be very noticeable when we scale such prior knowledge to interpret molecular readouts.
